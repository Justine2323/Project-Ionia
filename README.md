# Project-Ionia
## 📌 Overview 
<p align="justify">
Purpose : For entry to the upcoming event of ECES-IECEP UE-Caloocan Campus named "ASICUP" competition and also for my final project in final term of Robotics Technology laboratory
</p>

<p align="justify">
The Ionia Project was a compact 20×20 cm autonomous sumobot designed for the upcoming ASICUP competition. The robot is built for fast detection, strong pushing power, and reliable opponent tracking inside the sumo ring. It combines distance sensing and edge detection to make quick movement decisions during matches. The system uses an Arduino Uno as the main controller, driving high-torque worm gear DC motors for strong traction and controlled speed. Multiple sensors are integrated to improve battlefield awareness and prevent ring-out.

## Part 1: Planning
<p align="justify">
Project-Ionia focuses on integrating the mechanical design, electronics, and control strategy of a 20×20 sumobot for the ASICUP competition into one unified system before construction. This stage defines how the Arduino Uno, 490 RPM worm gear DC motors, two Sharp IR sensors, and three ultrasonic sensors will work together through proper sensor placement, motor configuration, and wiring layout to achieve reliable opponent detection, strong pushing capability, and accurate edge avoidance. It also includes setting performance targets, mapping the behavior logic (search, attack, and escape), and organizing the chassis structure and power distribution so that all subsystems operate efficiently and cohesively during matches.
